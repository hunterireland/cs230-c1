OVERVIEW:

  A simple simulation of a society to demonstrate how living
  in a society increases likelihood of survival -- the benefits
  outweight the costs. 
 

INCLUDED FILES:
 
 * Simulation.java - source file
 * Person.java - source file
 * Skill.java - source file
 * Disaster.java - source file
 * Mode.java - source file
 * README - this file

RUNNING:

With Java installed on your machine, run the following command from the command
line to compile the program: 

    $ javac Simulation.java

Run with the following command:

    $ java Simulation -a/-s

    Where -a will run the simulation in Anarchy mode and -s will run the 
    simulation in society mode. 

    Results will be output to the console after the society has either fallen, 
    or survived for one year. 

EXAMPLE RUN:

Running in anarchy mode...

ANALYSIS: 

  The average number of days survived over 100 runs:
    Anarchy mode: 11.61 
    Society mode: 182.06

  This was a really fun programming challenge! I haven't done a whole lot
  of programming in Java over the summer (mostly C# which is at least similar)
  but this was a good way to get back into it. I felt like I was programming
  a video game and seeing the results after running each simulation is really
  gratifying. 

  My results were as expected, I was actually surprised to see that sometimes 
  in society mode they would make it the entire year! In anarchy mode, though, 
  they die pretty quickly. Sometimes in society mode they'd get some bad luck 
  too. Overall the program might be a little simplistic (ex. if the hunter 
  finds food in anarchy he only gets two, but if he finds food in society
  EVERYONE gets two) but it is a good overview of why specialization and society
  works as a whole. Definitely preferable over anarchy!
